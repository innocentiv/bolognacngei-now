# Bologna CNGEI Public Repository
This is the public source code for https://iscrizioni.bolognacngei.it/. This website is a prototype tool for managing the enrollment data and fee for the CNGEI scout group in Bologna.

This is only for code review, and some configuration files are deleted. The actual development is done on a private repository.
